<p>I thought it would be fun one night to write a 3D engine in
JavaScript.  The next afternoon, I had this.  Originally <a

<h2>Problems</h2>

<p>It's not perfect, for sure; I mean, heck, I spent less than a day
on it.  In case I come back to it later, I made the following list of
its biggest problems.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Because all the loops and all the math are in JavaScript, and
  because &lt;canvas&gt; drawing is painfully slow, it's painfully
  slow.  On a dual-core 1.8GHz machine, it does around 3000 polygons
  per second, with a single lighting source and flat shading.  There
  might be room in there to double its speed.  But it's still fast
  enough to be cool. (I mean, hey, that's about as fast as Mesa,
  right? :) )</li>
 <li>I haven't implemented Gouraud shading yet.</li>
 <li>I wish I could implement texture-mapping, but I'm pretty sure
  that'll be too slow.</li>
 <li>On one hand, it's great that the &lt;canvas&gt; widget does
  antialiased drawing with alpha by default.  But I wish I could turn
  it off for this &mdash; it results in dotted lines running down the
  diagonals of all the rectangles.  I could work around this to some
  extent by supporting rectangles (well, planar quadrilaterals) as a
  primitive, but that still leaves dotted dark lines running down the
  joints between them.  Supersampling antialiasing (where each pixel
  starts out as 4 or 9 pixels in a super-res image) would work.</li>
 <li>There's, like, no UI.  There are some nifty solid-modeling things
  in the code that aren't obvious from the UI.</li>
 <li>If you change the state of one of the checkboxes while "Go" is
  unchecked, nothing happens until you check "Go" again; </li>
 <li>There are still big optimization opportunities in the code; for example:
  <ul>
    <li> You could store the normals and transform them with the
     matrix instead of doing a cross-product on every polygon every frame;</li>
    <li> And in this object, there are eight times as many polygons as
     there are normals, so you could win even bigger;</li>
    <li> It's not even doing backface removal because I'm too dumb to figure out
     how to do it safely with perspective;</li>
    <li> If you had a numerical-array library like NumPy or PDL in
     your browser, you could probably make it 100 times faster,
     roughly as fast as a normal software renderer; also, the code
     would be a lot simpler; </li>
    <li> If you were doing it in 3D hardware, you could probably make
     it 100 times faster again;</li>
    <li> Maybe there's some way to do the Z-sort without invoking a
     JavaScript function for every pair of elements to be compared; </li>
    <li> There are lots of places where we might be able to cons less
     by preallocating arrays of the right size; </li>
    <li> And, going even further, there's really no reason it needs to
     cons at all when going from one frame to the next &mdash; it
     should be able to run in constant space;</li>
    <li> This is probably irrelevant except for the wire-frame, but
     unrolling the loops in 'xform' would probably make it faster; </li>
    <li> The 'extrude_shape' function may generate the same points and
     lines twice &mdash; in the torus, there are two copies of the
     beginning/end circle. </li>
 </ul></li>
 <li>The stitching logic in 'extrude_shape' is pretty tightly tied to
  how 'augment' works.</li>
 <li>Also, maybe it would be nice to be able to pull out that logic
  for use in some other kind of mesh-generation code, like something
  that graphs a height field or a parametric function.</li>
</ul>
